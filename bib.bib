    abstract = {Sensory conflict theory explains that motion sickness in virtual reality (VR) systems can be caused due to the mismatch between visual and vestibular senses. This study examines whether coupling physical motions to visual stimuli in VR could reduce this discomfort. A motion-coupled VR system developed on a motion platform, providing vestibular cues to supplement visual roll from a head-mounted display (HMD), was used. Three conditions were tested: visual rotation only (stationary), visual-physical motion synchronised (synchronous), and vestibular motion with a self-referenced visual environment. Results show that when users are placed under a visual-vestibular synchronised condition, their subjective miserable score of cybersickness decreased while their comfort level of the overall experience increased. This indicates that a motion-coupled system, if integrated seamlessly in VR, could mitigate cybersickness symptoms.}

    abstract = {Entertainment and in particular gaming is currently considered one of the main application scenarios for virtual reality (VR). The majority of current games rely on any form of locomotion through the virtual environment while some techniques can lead to simulator sickness. Game developers are currently implementing a wide variety of locomotion techniques to cope with simulator sickness (e.g. teleportation). In this work we implemented and evaluated four different controller-based locomotion methods that are popular in current VR games (free teleport, fixpoint teleport, touchpad-based, automatic). We conducted a user study (n = 24) in which participants explored a virtual zoo with these four different controller-based locomotion methods and assessed their effects on discomfort, presence, enjoyment, and affective state. The results of our study show that free teleport locomotion elicited least discomfort and provided the highest scores for enjoyment, presence, and affective state. With these results we gained valuable insights for developers and researchers implementing first person locomotion in VR experiences.},

    abstract = {Consumer-grade head-mounted displays (HMD) such as the Oculus Rift have become increasingly available for Virtual Reality recently. Their high degree of immersion and presence provokes usually amazement when first used. Nevertheless, HMDs also have been reported to cause adverse reactions such as simulator sickness. As their impact is growing, it is important to understand such side effects. This paper presents the results of a relatively large scale user experiment which compares using a conventional game controller versus positioning in the virtual world based upon the signal of the internal Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) using Oculus Rift DK1. We show that simulator sickness is significantly reduced when using a position estimation system rather than using the more traditional game controller for navigation. However the sense of presence was not enhanced by the possibility of 'real walking'. We also show the impact of other factors, such as prior experience or motion history, and discuss the results.},

First, we present findings from a survey that received 25 responses and gives insights into wheelchair users' motives to (non-) engage with VR and their experiences. Drawing from this survey, we derive design implications which we tested through implementation and qualitative evaluation of three full-body VR game prototypes with 18 participants. Our results show that VR gaming engages wheelchair users, though nuanced consideration is required for the design of embodied immersive experiences for minority bodies, and we illustrate how designers can create meaningful, positive experiences.},

We then evaluate this method of walking in place by comparing it to normal walking and another previously published inexpensive method of exploration, arm swinging. In an experiment that compares the spatial awareness, we show that walking in place is not as good as walking on foot, but it is is better than arm swinging. Subjects also complete blind locomotion distance estimation trials in each of the locomotion conditions.},

Walking-in-place (WIP) offers a natural and immersive form of virtual locomotion that can reduce simulation sickness. WIP, however, is difficult to implement in mobile contexts as it typically relies on bulky controllers or an external camera. We present VR-STEP; a WIP implementation that uses real-time pedometry to implement virtual locomotion. VR-STEP requires no additional instrumentation outside of a smartphone's inertial sensors. A user study with 18 users compares VR-STEP with a commonly used auto-walk navigation method and finds no significant difference in performance or reliability, though VR-STEP was found to be more immersive and intuitive.},

This discrepancy between physical and virtual dimensions renders traditional locomotion methods used in real world unfeasible. To alleviate these limitations, research roposed various artificial locomotion concepts such as teleportation, treadmills, and redirected walking. However, these concepts occupy the user's hands, require complex hardware or large physical spaces. In this paper, we contribute nine VR locomotion concepts for foot-based locomotion, relying on the 3D position of the user's feet and the pressure applied to the sole as input modalities. We evaluate our concepts and compare them to state-of-the-art point &amp; teleport technique in a controlled experiment with 20 participants. The results confirm the viability of our approaches for foot-based and engaging locomotion. Further, based on the findings, we contribute a wireless hardware prototype implementation.},
